Description: Techniques from a particular branch of spatial statistics,termed geographically-weighted (GW) models. GW models suit situations when data are not described well by some global model, but where there are spatial regions where a suitably localised calibration provides a better description. 'GWmodel' includes functions to calibrate: GW summary statistics (Brunsdon et al., 2002)<doi: 10.1016/s0198-9715(01)00009-6>, GW principal components analysis (Harris et al., 2011)<doi: 10.1080/13658816.2011.554838>, GW discriminant analysis (Brunsdon et al., 2007)<doi: 10.1111/j.1538-4632.2007.00709.x> and various forms of GW regression (Brunsdon et al., 1996)<doi: 10.1111/j.1538-4632.1996.tb00936.x>; some of which are provided in basic and robust (outlier resistant) forms.
